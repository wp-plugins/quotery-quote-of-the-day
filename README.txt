Quote of The Day widget by Quotery featuring a beautiful design, social sharing, category selection, photos & more.

== Description ==

Everyone loves a bit of wit, wisdom, humor, and inspiration. So why not give your readers what they want with a beautiful display of daily quotes?

Our WordPress plugin does just that. However, being quotation fanatics ourselves, we wanted to develop something that was not only easy to use, but also feature-packed.

[Quotery](http://www.quotery.com "Modern source for quotes.") is an online encyclopedia of quotations, quips, and proverbs. We take pride in providing accurate attributions, relevant information about each quote, author biographies, exclusive picture quotes, and a stunning website design.

In other words, we pay attention to the details, which means you can be confident that our plugin is top-notch.

= Features =

*   **Ease-of-Use:** Simply drag and drop the widget where you want it to show and a new quote will appear every day.
*   **Custom Title:** Choose a name for the widget to match your preference.
*   **Category Selection:** With over 400 different topics to choose from, there’s something for everyone here. Own a finance blog? Show quotes about money. A relationship magazine? Quotes about dating, marriage, or love should have you covered. A forum for students? Education, teaching, learning, and college quotes will work wonderfully. Or maybe you’re having a hard time deciding on just one topic? Not a problem, just show them all.
*   **Beautiful Design:** We know how important it is to have a clean, well-designed website. Our daily quote widget will complement your theme’s aesthetics, rather than sticking out like an ugly, sore thumb.
*   **Color Options:** Choose between dark, light, or orange.
*   **Author Display:** A photograph of the author, along with the time period in which they lived, can be enabled/disabled.
*   **Social Sharing:** Give your readers the opportunity to share the quotes on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and/or *   Tumblr with optional social sharing buttons.
*   **Thousands of Quotes:** With one of the world’s largest collections of quotes, you’ll never have to worry about running out of fresh content.
*   **And More:** We’re always open to feedback and suggestions. Have an idea that you’d like to see implemented? Let us know!
