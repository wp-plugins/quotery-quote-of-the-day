Everyone loves a bit of wit, wisdom, humor, and inspiration. So why not give your readers what they want with a beautiful display of daily quotes?

[Quotery](http://www.quotery.com "Quips, Quotes & Proverbs") is one of the world’s largest, most accurate sources of famous quotations. Using our WordPress plugin, publishers can take advantage of our collection and automatically serve quotes on their website.

*   **Ease-of-Use:** Simply drag and drop the widget where you want it to show and a new quote will appear every day.

*   **Custom Title:** Choose a name for the widget to match your preference.

*   **Category Selection:** With over 400 different topics to choose from, there’s something for everyone here. Whether you run a tech blog, a relationship magazine, or a student forum. We’ve got quotes about money, love, education, optimism, success… you name it. Or maybe you’re having a hard time deciding on just one topic? Not a problem, there’s an option to include them all.

*   **Beautiful Design:** We know how important it is to have a clean, well-designed website. Our daily quote widget will complement your theme’s aesthetics, rather than diminish it.

*   **Author Display:** A photograph of the author, along with the time period in which they lived, can be enabled/disabled.

*   **Social Sharing:** Give your readers the opportunity to share the quotes on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and Tumblr with optional social sharing buttons.
